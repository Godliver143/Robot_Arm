# Robot_Arm

	This project is a robot arm built by myself and my team mate Seth Deli.

INTRODUCTION

	The robot arm is a type of  mechanical arm, usually programmable,
	with similar functions to a human arm; the arm may be the total sum of
	the mechanism or may be part of a more complex robot.
	The robot arm is connected to the internet and controlled on the phone
	through a bluetooth connection between the phone and the arm.  
	
MATERIALS USED:

	1.	4 Servo Motors
	2.	1 ESP32
	3.	2 Woods
	4.	Flexible Cables
	5.	Breadboard

PURPOSE:

	The purpose of the robot arm is to mechanically pick up items 
	around its sphere of contact and drop them where necessary.

CONCEPT:

	The robot arm is built with four servo mottos,
	pieces of wood, flexible cables, breadboard and an ESP32.

FUNCTIONS OF EACH PART:

	1.	The servo motto 1 will enable the robot arm move at an angle 
			180 degrees from the left at 0 degrees to the right at 180 degrees
			and vice versa.
	
	2.	The servo motto 2 ,located above the servo 1 and used to move
			the robot arm up and down at 180 degrees.
			
	3.	The third servo moves the grip up and down to enable it grap
			objects form any angle between 0-180 degerees.
	
	4.	The last servon  which is the fourth servo controls the gripping of objects.
			The servo allows the grip to open at an angle correspponding to the size of the object to grap.
	
MODE OF COMMUNICATION:


		A mobile app is developed of which by Bluetooth connection 
		with the MCU will enable communication between the mobile 
		phone and the robot arm.
